## Part 1 - Randomized Quicksort vs Deterministic Quicksort

In order to execute the randomized quicksort vs deterministic quicksort experiment and fetch the data run the code using the following:

```
python3 assignment_3_part_1.py
```

This will execute the experiment where we run randomized quicksort and deterministic quicksort on various types of data. This outputs the results to the terminal. I have captured the results for my run which I analyze and discuss in my report in a file named `results_part_1.txt`. 

## Part 2 - Hash Table with Collision Chaining with Varying Load Factors

In order to execute the hash table with collision chaining across load factors experiment and fetch the data run the code using the following:

```
python3 assignment_3_part_2.py
```

This will execute the experiment where we run the hash table with collision chaining of 10,000 elements across various load factors (0.1, 0.25, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0). This outputs the results to the terminal. I have captured the results for my run which I analyze and discuss in my report in a file named `results_part_2.txt`.
